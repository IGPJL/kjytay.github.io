	<p>I am a rising third-year PhD student with Stanford's <a target="_blank" href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/">Department of Statistics</a>, advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/">Rob Tibshirani</a>. I am broadly interested in statistical learning, with specific interests in developing methods which use structure in the data to yield better prediction and inference. I am also really interested in the relationship between statistical analyses and actual decision making, as well as how statistics is communicated to the public and in the classroom.</p>

	<p>My past work experience has been with the Singapore Government. Most recently, I was a data scientist at IDA Singapore's Data Science Division (now under <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/">GovTech</a>), where I worked with various government agencies to analyze their data in suport of public policies and services. I also have previous experience in public policy with Singapore's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mewr.gov.sg/">Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources</a> and Ministry of Defence.</p>

  <p>I run a blog, <a target="_blank" href="https://statisticaloddsandends.wordpress.com/">Statistical Odds & Ends</a>, where I write short posts about concepts and ideas in statistics and related fields which interest me. This is also a place for me to clarify some of my thoughts and pen down notes for future reference; hopefully it can be of use to others!</p>

	<p>My wife runs a really cool blog titled <a target="_blank" href="https://techandpublicgood.com/">Technology and Public Good</a>, where she discusses how the tech, business and government sectors can work together to solve social challenges. Together, we have a beautiful daughter who never fails to make us laugh :)</p>
