      <p>I love to watch sports, especially international tournaments like the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup. For FIFA World Cup 2018, I compiled some basic statistics for the matches and countries, and did some basic data analyses. The data and analysis files are available on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kjytay/FIFA-world-cup-2018">Github</a>.</p>

      <p>I often find myself googling the same keywords over and over again, piecing together information across various sites to (re-)learn the derivation of or intuition behind statistical results. This blog is a way for me to pen down what I've learned as a form of knowledge retention, as well as to post short statistical tidbits that randomly pop into my head.</p>

      <p>I used to run a blog where I posted math olympiad problems and solutions. The goal was to bring students beyond reading complete proofs to understanding how the author thought of the solutions (and how they could have thought of it themselves). The blog also has an accompanying <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/beyondmathsolns">Twitter handle</a>.</p>
