      <p>I used to run a blog where I posted math olympiad problems and solutions. The goal was to bring students beyond reading complete proofs to understanding how the author thought of the solutions (and how they could have thought of it themselves). The blog also has an accompanying <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/beyondmathsolns">Twitter handle</a>.</p>
